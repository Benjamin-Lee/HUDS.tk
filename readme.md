## Introduction

This URL redirector was made with love to be a memorable way to access the HUDS menu for Harvard undergraduates. The HUDS site's menu's URL is dynamically generated and therefore impossible to bookmark or remember. No more!

## How it works

The system is an HTML page with a JavaScript snippet that calculates the URL for the current menu and redirects you.

## Bugs

I highly doubt there are any bugs (the whole HTML file is <50 lines long), but if there are, please contact me at [benjamin_lee@college.harvard.edu](mailto:benjamin_lee@college.harvard.edu?subject=Dhall). I intend to maintain this app until my graduation in May 2020, so if HUDS changes their menu URL scheme, I'll be sure to update the redirector.
